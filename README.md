# NadekoBot + Docker = Nadecker!

Latest Update: July 5, 2018 [2]

This is a docker container based on a upstream-maintained (but slight changes) version of [NadekoBot](http://github.com/shikhir-arora/NadekoBot).

Upstream is auto-synced and kept up-to-date with the NadekoBot/1.9 (latest) branch thanks to the awesome [Backstroke](https://backstroke.co/) app.

- Forked from  `willysunny/Nadecker`
